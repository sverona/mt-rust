Today I woke up from a rather pleasant midday nap to find out that the
Mariners [[https://www.mlb.com/news/eugenio-suarez-d-backs-trade][traded
Geno Su√°rez]] for a bag of chips and a half-eaten ham sandwich.

This incensed me so thoroughly that I went out and ran a 3.5-minute PB
5K. It was also a big fat milestone --- my first sub-30 since I started
HRT, years and years ago. (And to point out how big of a difference it
makes, my /slowest/ testosterone-aided 5K was 28:45.)

That's the big thing I'm proud of this week. But it should be noted that
on Monday I ran about 7.5K, which is by fiat the longest run I've
recorded since HRT.
