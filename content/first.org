This blog was born from conjunction, as are so many things. /Axaxaxas
mlö./

The anagram that forms the name of this blog was lifted from
[[https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/17nrskz/lamb_nags_ram_mlb_anagrams_of_all_30_teams_i_put/][a
Reddit post]] I stumbled across the other day. I also spotted
[[https://arne.me/articles/write-your-own-ssg][a post telling me to
write my own static site generator]] on lobste.rs. It even gave a list
of Rust crates. I felt fate calling me and surrendered to its whims.

I schlepped up to Rockford this Saturday. It was a perfect day for it
--- a bit unseasonable for Michigan in November, but I'll take it.
Quickwater Coffee Roasters is a beautiful little joint by the Rogue
River. Few things make me as happy as a good pourover in good weather
and the sound of running water. There's even a cute indie bookstore a
little up the plaza, although I didn't have time to stop in.

I locked up out back and chatted with friends.
[[https://www.hoytarcane.com][Hoyt Arcane]] texted me and we had a quick
chat about math and plans and brains. Although, looking at his blog, I
feel the need to mention that I don't actually have a PhD, although
since I'm published I do get regular spam emails calling me Dr. MT.

27 miles in total. I promised myself when I cycled a marathon I'd get
myself some actual cycling shoes and kit. So I will, next paycheck. It's
a bit cold for Lycra out there right now, but keeping my word to myself
is the important thing.

My next goal is 40k in one go. I'm getting a lot better about
remembering to brace my core.
