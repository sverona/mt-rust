** Servus!

I'm a big dork who wrote this thing in /org-mode/ and then compiled it to a static site with a custom Rust thing I derived from someone else.

*This is some bold text.*

#+begin_src python :results output
def gcd(a, b):
	print(a, b)
	return a if b == 0 else gcd(b, a % b)

print(gcd(833, 42))
#+end_src
