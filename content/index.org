#+TITLE: My adventures living in Lycra

ðŸ‘‹ /Servus!/

I'm a rather butch trans girl who likes solving puzzles, doing math, writing code, swimming, cycling, running, and lifting weights. You could say I'm like, a level 10 nerd and a level 3 jock.

This site is written in [org-mode]() and built with [a custom SSG I wrote in Rust.]
