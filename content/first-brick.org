It's a little baby one, but it counts. Every house has to start
somewhere. :)

10k on the bike, 5k run, took me about an hour including transition
(unlock the door, say hi to the hubby, leave the bike behind the couch,
change out of cycling shoes into VFFs, say "gotta run," hit the road.)
This is exactly half of a Sprint. I guess this makes me a
sesqui-athlete?

I love getting fitter. It's the best. I could literally do this all the
time. And I /am/ going to do this literally all the time. I love my
life.

Also, I got some absolute god-tier luck today and hit a 20.84 single 3x3
solve. Cross + 1 was free, then another F2L pair just happened to match
up, then antisune, then H-perm. That's a four-second PB. What I find
amazing is that so much of advanced cubing seems to be all about making
this sort of solve happen /every/ time. Quite literally, they make their
own luck. It's bonkers.
