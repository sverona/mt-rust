I went up to Rockford again to hang out with a friend who's a real
triathlete (she runs like 30 races a year.) We had a good chat over
coffee. She indicated I should probably start doing interval training
again, which isn't a bad idea --- I haven't set up a formal training
plan yet, with periodization and all that, but for the time being I
intend to work out five/six days a week: two run days (long run and
speed work/hill reps), two cycling days (long ride and interval
training), one brick, and a swim day once I get that sorted out.

Ran 9k today, in about 1'09”. Works out to a 7'39”/km pace. I'm content
with that. It's really slow, but who gives a shit.
