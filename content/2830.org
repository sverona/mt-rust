I did it! This is a really big deal for me, because

1. It's a PR by a minute and a half.
2. It's 15 seconds faster than my slowest 5K pre-HRT.
3. It's age-grade equivalent to my /fastest/ 5K pre-HRT. (24:56.)

Fuck yeah.

More importantly, my pace was pretty good and level. There were a couple
of bursts of speed, but I hung around a 5'40‚Äù/km pace the whole time,
disregarding my pacer app, which I found out was set to the wrong units,
and so expected me to be running 6-minute miles the whole time. Yeah,
no. Maybe someday.

And (/knocks on wood/) after a good stretch and yoga session I don't
feel any problems at all. I used to hurt myself when I pushed this fast.
Yay!
