/Servus!/

I'm a cyclist and runner finally submitting to my longtime aspiration of
becoming a triathlete. I'm an ethical vegan. I'm a fan of the Seattle
Mariners who doesn't know nearly enough about sabermetrics. I'm a word
nerd and cruciverbalist who went to summer camp and sat in the corner
studying OLL algorithms and Scrabble words while all the other kids
played. The name of this blog combines all these interests.

I also happen to be a fountain of blood in the shape of a girl, but
that's quite beside the point.

This site is presently built with Jekyll. I intend to replace it with a
custom SSG written in Rust that meets my exacting standards for
typography and design.

Part of the IntersectingSquares webring. (Which I haven't actually
registered the domain for, please hold.)
